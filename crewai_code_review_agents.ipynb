            "1. **Code Correctness:**\n",
            "   - The code correctly connects to an SQLite database, executes a query, and fetches data. The logic of the code appears sound for a database query operation.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Performance Optimization Opportunities:**\n",
            "   - Consider using `contextlib.closing` or a context manager (`with statement`) for automatically handling the cleanup of the database connection and cursor, which can make the code cleaner and more robust in managing exceptions.\n",
            "   - Since the function can be used with large datasets, consider using `fetchmany(size)` to fetch chunks of rows if the entire result set might be large.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Documentation Quality:**\n",
            "   - The docstring is well-written and clear. However, it could include the return type in more detail (e.g., `List[tuple]` specifier instead of `List[Any]`) since each row typically returns a tuple.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Type Hint Usage:**\n",
            "   - The type hints used are generally good. However, enhancing the return type from `List[Any]` to `List[tuple]` can add a layer of clarity regarding what kind of data structure is returned.\n",
            "   - The `cursor` and `connection` variables could have type hints as well. For instance, `Optional[sqlite3.Connection]` and `Optional[sqlite3.Cursor]` to enhance readability.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Edge Cases Handling:**\n",
            "   - The function checks for an empty query, which is good. However, it's also beneficial to validate that `db_path` is not empty and catch the `sqlite3.OperationalError` that might occur with invalid database paths or SQL issues like table not found.\n",
